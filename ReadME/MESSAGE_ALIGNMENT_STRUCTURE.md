# Message Alignment Structure - Connect Chat Application

## Overview
The message alignment has been restructured to provide a clear, consistent layout where:
- **Sent messages** (from current user) appear on the **RIGHT side**
- **Received messages** (from other users) appear on the **LEFT side**

## Visual Structure

### Sent Messages (Right Side)
```
                                [Avatar] [Message Bubble] [Actions]
                                    👤   💬 Hello there!      ⋯
```

### Received Messages (Left Side)
```
[Avatar] [Message Bubble] [Actions]
   👤    💬 Hi back!        ⋯
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Clear Alignment**
- **Sent messages**: `justify-end` with left padding (pl-16) to push content right
- **Received messages**: `justify-start` with right padding (pr-16) to keep content left
- Maximum width of 75% to prevent messages from spanning full width

### 2. **Consistent Component Order**
- **Sent messages**: Avatar → Message → Actions (right to left)
- **Received messages**: Avatar → Message → Actions (left to right)
- Uses `flex-row-reverse` for sent messages and `flex-row` for received messages

### 3. **Enhanced Styling**
- **Sent messages**: Blue background (`bg-blue-500`) with white text
- **Received messages**: White background with border and dark text
- Improved message bubbles with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Better spacing and typography

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- Adaptive padding that adjusts to screen size
- Touch-friendly targets for mobile devices
- Proper text wrapping and overflow handling

## Technical Implementation

### Container Structure
```tsx
<div className="flex w-full py-1 px-3">
  <div className="flex items-end gap-3 max-w-[75%]">
    <Avatar />
    <div className="flex flex-col">
      <MessageBubble />
      <SeenIndicator />
    </div>
    <ActionsMenu />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Conditional Classes
```tsx
// Main container alignment
{
  "justify-end pl-16": fromCurrentUser,     // Sent: right with left padding
  "justify-start pr-16": !fromCurrentUser, // Received: left with right padding
}

// Component order
{
  "flex-row-reverse": fromCurrentUser,  // Sent: reverse order
  "flex-row": !fromCurrentUser,         // Received: normal order
}

// Content alignment
{
  "items-end": fromCurrentUser,    // Sent: align right
  "items-start": !fromCurrentUser, // Received: align left
}
```

### Message Bubble Styling
```tsx
// Sent messages
"bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-br-md"

// Received messages  
"bg-white text-gray-900 border border-gray-200 rounded-bl-md"
```
